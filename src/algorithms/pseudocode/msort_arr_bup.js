\\Note{ This is a copied+modified version of the top down mergesort pseudocode.
Merge is identical and bookmarks have been left in (but more will be needed
for the code that is not the same). Ideally the animation sould look as
similar to the top down version as possible.  There is no call stack but
runlength could be displayed where the top down stack is displayed.
